abstract ={New hexagonal aluminous (NAL) phase and orthorhombic calcium-ferrite (CF) type phase are considered to be major mantle components of the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) at pressure and temperature conditions in the lower mantle, which can potentially host alkali elements with large ionic radii. The high-pressure stability and elastic properties of both NAL and CF phases are therefore of fundamental importance for understanding the fate of subducted MORB. Here we report those properties of the NaMg2Al5SiO12 system studied by means of the first-principles computation method. NAL was found to transform to the CF phase at 39.6 GPa, accompanied by discontinuities in density (+1.8%), as well as compressional wave (−0.2%), shear wave (+0.9%), and bulk sound (−1.0%) velocities. The property of subducted MORB was evaluated using these results, and the velocity contrast between pyrolite and MORB of ~−5% was found to be quite comparable to the shear velocity anomaly observed for seismic scatterers at depths from 1100 to 1800 km. However, since the transformation of the NAL to CF phase within MORB produces insignificant increases in the seismic velocities, it would be seismologically undetectable. On the other hand, the anisotropy change associated with the phase transition is significant and could be seismically detectable using observations such as shear wave splitting measurements since the CF phase is considerably more anisotropic compared to the NAL phase.},

abstract ={An intensive source of intermediate depth earthquakes has been located in northern Colombia. The activity of this source increased significantly between 1956 and 1966, but appears to be decreasing after 1966. The frequency-magnitude relation of the Bucaramanga earthquakes is anomalous, with fewer large earthquakes than expected. The distribution of determined hypocenters is the same as would be observed if all earthquakes originated in the same point source. Therefore it is concluded that the Bucaramanga seismic source consists of a volume, less than 10 km in radius, centered at 6.8°N, 73.1°W., and 150 km depth.},

Congruent peridotite melting at ambient conditions of 1.5 GPa and 470 °C requires a temperature increase of 1280 °C to 1750 °C. We assume that more than 95\% of the work is converted to heat during faulting, hence that the stress drop is nearly proportional to the amount of melting and inversely proportional to shear strain. Minimum estimates of released stress are typically greater than 220 MPa and as high as 580 MPa. The abundance of pseudotachylyte on small faults in the studied peridotite suggests that melting is very common on intermediate and deep earthquakes and that shear heating is important for seismic faulting at depth.",

	abstract = "Thermal models of subduction zones often base their slab-wedge geometry from seismicity at mantle depths and, consequently, cannot be used to evaluate the relationship between seismicity and structure. Here, high-resolution seismic observations from the recent Broadband Experiment Across the Alaska Range (BEAAR) constrain, in a rare instance, the subducting slab geometry and mantle wedge temperature independent of seismicity. Receiver functions reveal that the subducting crust descends less steeply than the Wadati-Beinoff Zone. Attenuation tomography of the mantle wedge reveals a high Q and presumably cold region where the slab is less than 80 km deep. To understand these two observations, we generate thermal models that use the improved wedge geometry from receiver functions and that incorporate temperature- and strain-rate-dependent olivine rheology. These calculations show that seismicity within the subducting crust falls in a narrow belt of pressure-temperature conditions, illuminating an effective Clapeyron slope of 0.1 K/N4Pa at temperatures of 450-750 degrees C. These conditions typify the breakdown of high-pressure hydrous minerals such as lawsonite and suggest that a single set of dehydration reactions may trigger intermediate-depth seismicity. The models also require that the upper, cold nose of the mantle wedge be isolated from the main flow in the mantle wedge in order to sustain the cold temperatures inferred from the Q tomography. Possibly, sufficient mechanical decoupling occurs at the top of the downgoing slab along a localized shear zone to 80 km depth, considerably deeper than inferred from thrust zone seismicity.

The sP phases were recorded about 7-11 s after the initial P phases, with both phases having almost the same apparent velocities. The computation of ray-paths revealed that the arrival times of the later sP phases are sensitive to focal depths. We have recalculated the hypocenters and origin times for 36 events with more than six s P phase identifications on seismograms recorded at the High Sensitivity Seismograph Network by including s P phases in a double-difference earthquake location algorithm, which eliminates the errors introduced by crustal heterogeneity. The relocation results were then compared with those from the Japan Meteorological Agency based on traditional absolute location techniques.",

The lithosphere is characterised by an elastic or elastoplastic behaviour and the asthenosphere by a homogeneous isoviscous fluid. The temperature effects are ignored and viscosity and density are constant in time. The solid and the fluid problem are discretised by the finite elements method (FEM). The same solid code used in Hassani et al. [Hassani, R., Jongmans, D., Chery, J., Study of plate deformation and stress in subduction processes using two-dimensional numerical models,J. Geophys. Res. (1997) 102 17951-17965.] has been used to compute the solution of the solid problem. The Stokes problem is solved by a direct solver with a stabilisation procedure. We used a very simple staggered coupling method where the fluid domain is regularly re-meshing. We observed numerical instabilities when the time step is not sufficiently small, especially when strong Coupling between the solid and the fluid occurs. We have tested different configurations where the lithosphere is elastic or elastoplastic and show how the slab geometry, the topography and the stress regime in the plates are affected by the Viscous resistance of the mantle. We observed that the asthenosphere viscosity is a fundamental parameter in the subduction process. For subduction with an extensional regime in the upper plate, we observe a linear decrease of the extensional stress as a function of the asthenospheric viscosity. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this work we use a fully 3-D mechanical numerical model to analyse the impact of the plate boundary geometry on the deformation of the upper plate. The model consists of two initially horizontal independent plates overlying an inviscid fluid and continuously pushed towards each other. The initial geometry of the contact zone between the two plates controls the stress regime and the strain pattern in the upper plate. The case with a linear plate boundary and orthogonal convergence is first considered and used as a reference model. With this simple model, the effects of some important parameters (i.e. the interplate friction and the lithosphere-asthenosphere density contrast) are investigated. Finally, cases with curved plate boundaries are considered, and the results are used to shed light on the importance of the dip direction of the interplate plane for the upper plate strain pattern. Unnecessary oceanward convexity causes an accumulation of the subducted material beneath the upper plate and induces an important uplift of the convex area. On the contrary, the material escapes from an oceanward concavity and provokes subsidence in the forearc zone. Such a behaviour induces preferential zones of weakeness in the overriding plate and may allow for explaining some local stress regime variations along convergent margins.",

	abstract = "Using high-resolution, triplicate body waveforms, we investigate strong lateral variations in P and SH wave speeds (V-P and V-S) beneath the Tonga subduction zone where cold lithosphere is subducting rapidly at 200 mm yr(-1). Under these conditions, the lack of prominent anomalies of high V-P and V-S in the lower mantle implies that a large amount of recently subducted material remains above the lower mantle. This inference is also evident from a subhorizontal swath of outboard earthquakes in the transition zone that is up to 1000 km away from the Wadati-Benioff zone. Beneath the back arc, we find a sharp, east-west trending demarcation north of which outboard earthquakes occur and V-P and V-S abruptly drop by similar to3\%. Thus the effect of cold temperature to raise V-P and V-S, as indicated by the presence of outboard earthquakes, must be counteracted by petrologic variations. We interpret that outboard earthquakes occur where impounding of subducted metastable olivine or volatiles reduces seismic wave speeds and triggers deep earthquakes. Considering the density of these candidates and the strong effect of partial melt on V-S, volatiles in the form of hydrous phases or melt induced by dehydration are not consistent with observed reductions in V-P and V-S. Meanwhile, metastable olivine remains a viable candidate. As a cold slab passes below the 410-km discontinuity, olivine becomes metastable and makes the tip of the slab buoyant. Such a mechanism could explain why the leading end of a fast subducting slab may be successively sequestered in the transition zone.",

We characterize layer separation inside subducting plates with a coordinate rotation to calculate the slab-normal distribution of earthquakes. Benchmark tests on well-established examples confirm that layer separation is accurately quantified with global seismicity catalogs alone. Global analysis reveals double Benioff zones in 30 segments, including all 16 subduction zones investigated, with varying subducting plate ages and stress orientations, which implies that they are inherent in subducting plates. Layer separation increases with age and is more consistent with dehydration of antigorite than chlorite.",

	abstract = "[ 1] The termination of the Ryukyu trench against Eurasia and the oblique subduction of the Philippine Sea plate create a subduction-collision complex offshore Taiwan, which has not previously been elucidated in detail. We combine traveltime data from the seismic networks in Taiwan and Japan to better illuminate how the subducting Ryukyu slab deforms in this subduction-collision zone. More than 5000 events recorded by both networks were relocated with the double- difference method using an optimal regional one-dimensional velocity model. The offshore seismicity indicates that the double seismic zone, with a gap of 15 - 20 km, exists in the subducting slab in the depth range of 40 - 80 km. Focal mechanisms suggest that the double seismic zone is caused by east-west compression resulting from oblique convergence. The improved hypocentral locations for the first time reveal folding of the slab into a horizontal curvature larger in magnitude than and opposite in sign to that of the Ryukyu trench in the depth range 50 - 100 km. The anomalous curvature, together with the focal mechanisms, suggests that the slab folds against the Eurasian lithosphere and that this deformation cannot be fully elastic. We model this deformation mode as the developing instability of a viscoelastic Maxwell layer embedded in a viscous medium. The characteristic wavelength of the instability, i.e., similar to 250 km, is consistent with folding of a slab whose viscosity is 100 times higher than that of the surrounding mantle for an along-strike elastic membrane strain as small as 0.01, or more than 3 orders of magnitude higher if 5\% elastic strain is allowed.",

	volume = "8",
	pages = "--",
	abstract = "[1] Hydrothermal circulation and brittle faulting processes affecting the oceanic lithosphere are usually confined to the upper crust for oceanic lithosphere created at intermediate to fast spreading rates. Lower crust and mantle rocks are therefore relatively dry and undeformed. However, recent studies at subduction zones suggest that hydration of the oceanic plate is most vigorous at the trench-outer rise, where extensional bending-related faulting affects the hydrogeology of the oceanic crust and mantle. To understand the degree of hydration, we studied the seismic velocity structure of the incoming Nazca plate offshore of southern central Chile (similar to 43 degrees S); here the deep-sea trench is heavily filled with up to 2 km of sediments. Seismic refraction and wide-angle data, complemented by seismic reflection imaging of sediments, are used to derive a two-dimensional velocity model using joint refraction and reflection traveltime tomography. The seismic profile runs perpendicular to the spreading ridge and trench axes. The velocity model derived from the tomography inversion consists of a similar to 5.3-km-thick oceanic crust and shows P wave velocities typical for mature fast spreading crust in the seaward section of the profile, with uppermost mantle velocities as fast as similar to 8.3 km/s. Approaching the Chile trench, seismic velocities are significantly reduced, however, suggesting that the structures of both the oceanic crust and uppermost mantle have been altered, possibly due to a certain degree of fracturing and hydration. The decrease of the velocities roughly starts at the outer rise, similar to 120 km from the deformation front, and continues into the trench. Even though the trench is filled with sediment, basement outcrops in the outer rise frequently pierce the sedimentary blanket. Anomalously low heat flow values near outcropping basement highs indicate an efficient inflow of cold seawater into the oceanic crust. Hydration and crustal cracks activated by extensional bending-related faulting are suggested to govern the reduced velocities in the vicinity of the trench. Considering typical flow distances of 50 km, water might be redistributed over most of the trench-outer rise area. Where trapped in faults, seawater may migrate down to mantle depth, causing up to similar to 9\% of serpentinization in at least the uppermost similar to 2 km of the mantle between the outer rise and the trench axis.",

The low-strain rheology of olivine is well documented; however, deformation in the lithosphere often involves large strains. Large strain experiments show that recrystallization can result in both hardening and softening during deformation. Moderate strain softening in experimental shear and torsion can be explained by the operation of dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding in bands of fine recrystallized grains.Data on the temperature dependence of recrystallized grain size are needed to extrapolate the effects of dynamic recrystallization to the lithosphere. Theories of dynamic recrystallization suggest that grain size is strongly stress dependent and moderately temperature dependent. A re-analysis of experimental grain size data indicates that the recrystallized grain size is temperature independent for olivine aggregates with low water content (<300 ppm H/Si).Rheological regime maps have been constructed for the lithospheric mantle. The maps suggest that grain size sensitive power law creep, involving both grain boundary sliding and dislocation creep, will produce strong strain softening, greater than found so far in experimental studies, in dry and wet lithosphere shear zones.",

	abstract = "Two large earthquakes (Mw7.3 and Mw7.5) occurred off-shore of the Kii peninsula (Japan) on 5th September 2004. The insufficient station coverage in the area where the large events and their aftershocks occurred led to significant uncertainty regarding their depth location. By using a double-difference approach, we were able to determine more accurate hypocenter locations and better define the main characteristics of the aftershock distribution. The data we used in this study comprise of about 700 earthquakes recorded by the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) from 5 to 12 September 2004. We assume several depth ranges for the initial double difference earthquake locations and select the solution with the smallest ruts residual. The resulting hypocenter distribution has two distinctive features: 1) on average the depths are about 20 km shallower than the initial JMA location and 2) the hypocenters are divided into two groups: one shallow (around 12 km depth) and another deep (around 27 km depth). The epicenters of the relocated events define a finer, more clustered structure compared with the epicentral distribution of JMA. The splitting of the earthquake locations into two depth groups is still observed when using a significantly different velocity structure. Our results of the two depth groups for the hypocenters resemble the independently determined hypocentral distribution from the OBS survey.",

Flow in the wedge of mantle between the slab and the overriding plate is approximated by the corner flow of a Newtonian viscous fluid. The flow maintains an advective boundary layer on top of the slab that controls the temperature at the interface between the slab and the wedge. This temperature, the maximum temperature in the wedge above the slab, and the thickness of the advective boundary layer, all depend on a single dimensionless distance, Vrdelta(2)/kappa, where V is the speed of plate convergence, r is distance from the corner of the wedge, delta is the dip of the slab and kappa is thermal diffusivity. The observation that volcanic fronts at island arcs lie above places where the slab reaches a depth that correlates negatively with convergence rate and slab dip suggests that the thermal structure of subduction zones may be described by the simple scaling developed here, and that the locations of the arcs are controlled by a strongly temperature-dependent process taking place in the wedge.",

In these two regions, extensional processes started contemporaneously, around 30 Myr ago, but with marked differences. In the eastern region, the Aegean basin opened slowly (similar to1 cm/yr) behind a shallow dipping slab (40-45degrees). The corresponding high-velocity anomaly extends inside the upper mantle and can be also followed in the midmantle down to a depth of at least 1500 km. Its descent into the midmantle initiated most probably during the Late Cretaceous, and the trench moved northeastward, following the path of the Eurasian plate and under the persistent push of the African plate. Conversely, in the central Mediterranean region, subduction initiated later, and the motion of the subducting slab is confined to the upper mantle, causing punctuated and rapid episodes of back arc extension (Provencal and Tyrrhenian basins) behind a slab that dips steeply (75degrees). We explore the causes that control how the slab subducted and interacted with the lower, more viscous part of the mantle.",

The evolution of the WMSZ is characterized by a first phase of orogenic wedging followed, from 30 Ma on, by trench retreat and back-arc extension. Combining new and previous geological data, new tomographic images of the western Mediterranean mantle, and plate kinematics, we describe the evolution of the WMSZ during the last 35 Myr. Our reconstruction shows that the two arcs form by fragmentation of the 1500 km long WMSZ in small, narrow slabs. Once formed, these two narrow slabs retreat outward, producing back-arc extension and large scale rotation of the flanks, shaping the arcs. The Gibraltar Arc first formed during the middle Miocene, while the Calabrian Arc formed later, during the late Miocene-Pliocene. Despite the different paleogeographic settings, the mechanism of rupture and backward migration of the narrow slabs presents similarities on both sides of the western Mediterranean, suggesting that the slab deformation is also driven by lateral mantle flow that is particularly efficient in a restricted (upper mantle) style of mantle convection.",

Phases obtained at 2.1 GPa and 1503 K were periclase and a fluid with a small MgO content while those at 12 GPa and 1473 K were periclase and an MgO-rich liquid. Quench textures suggest that brucite dehydrates at least up to 4 GPa but melts incongruently at higher pressure. The incongruent melting temperature of brucite, that is wet solidus temperature of periclase, decreases with increasing pressure up to 20 GPa.

	abstract = "Deep earthquakes have been a paradox since their discovery in the 1920s. The combined increase of pressure and temperature with depth precludes brittle failure or frictional sliding beyond a few tens of kilometers, yet earthquakes occur continually in subduction zones to ≈700 km. The expected healing effects of pressure and temperature and growing amounts of seismic and experimental data suggest that earthquakes at depth probably represent self-organized failure analogous to, but different from, brittle failure. The only high-pressure shearing instabilities identified by experiment require generation of a small fraction of very weak material differing significantly in density from the parent material. This {\grqq}fluid” spontaneously forms mode I microcracks or microanticracks that self-organize via the elastic strain fields at their tips, leading to shear failure. Growing evidence suggests that the great majority of subduction zone earthquakes shallower than 400 km are initiated by breakdown of hydrous phases and that deeper ones probably initiate as a shearing instability associated with breakdown of metastable olivine to its higher-pressure polymorphs. In either case, fault propagation could be enhanced by shear heating, just as is sometimes the case with frictional sliding in the crust. Extensive seismological interrogation of the region of the Tonga subduction zone in the southwest Pacific Ocean provides evidence suggesting significant metastable olivine, with implication for its presence in other regions of deep seismicity. If metastable olivine is confirmed, either current thermal models of subducting slabs are too warm or published kinetics of olivine breakdown reactions are too fast."

Combined with geological observations, our seismic data suggest transient and local increases in crust permeability at specific highly dilating areas triggered by dynamical stresses from high-magnitude regional earthquakes. Fluids are then trapped at supercritical conditions in the deep brittle crust which, in turn, increases the capacity of the rocks to deform through cracking and faulting.

	abstract = "Studies of the inclusions contained in natural diamonds have shown the occurrence of minerals which must have formed at depths below the lithosphere and which may be closely matched with the silicate mineral assemblages determined by high pressure and temperature experimental studies for depths of 300 to 800 km in the Earth's mantle. The inclusions come principally from two main depth zones: (1) the lower asthenosphere and upper transition zone; (2) the Upper Mantle/Lower Mantle (UM/LM) boundary region and the uppermost LM. The inclusions from zone 1 are very largely majoritic garnets (with or without clinopyroxene) which indicate bulk compositions of eclogitic/metabasic affinity. The minerals from zone 2 include Ca-Si and Mg-Si perovskites and ferropericlase and are dominantly of metaperidotitic bulk composition, but include some possible metabasite assemblages. In many of these natural assemblages, the tetragonal almandine pyrope phase occurs rather than the garnet found in experiments. As natural diamonds are believed to crystallize in fluids/melts, the hypothesis is developed that the restriction of diamonds and inclusions of particular compositions to the above two depth intervals is because they are controlled by loci of fluid/melt occurrence. Attention is focused on subduction zones because both suites of inclusions show some evidence of subducted protoliths. The lower zone (600-800 km) coincides with the region where dehydration may be expected for hydrous ringwoodite and dense hydrous Mg-silicates formed in subducted peridotites. The dehydration of lawsonite in subducted metabasites provides a particular location for melt formation and the inclusion of the shallower ([~]300 km) majoritic inclusions. For the deeper majoritic inclusions in the region of the upper transition zone, melt development may occur as a consequence of the hydrous wadsleyite-to-olivine transformation, and such melt may then interact with the upper crustal portion of a subducting slab. These suggestions offer an explanation of the depth restrictions and the compositional restrictions of the inclusions. The differences in {delta}13C values in the host diamonds for the two suites of inclusions may also be explained on this basis. ",

We use these data to calculate {H$_2$O} content, density and seismic wave speeds of subduction zone rocks. These calculations provide a new basis for evaluating the subduction factory, including (1) the presence of hydrous phases and the distribution of {H$_2$O} within a subduction zone; (2) the densification of the subducting slab and resultant effects on measured gravity and slab shape; and (3) the variations in seismic wave speeds resulting from thermal and metamorphic processes at depth. In considering specific examples, we find that for ocean basins worldwide the lower oceanic crust is partially hydrated (< 1.3 wt \% {H$_2$O}), and the uppermost mantle ranges from unhydrated to \&SIM;20\% serpentinized (\&SIM;2.4 wt \% {H$_2$O}). Anhydrous eclogite cannot be distinguished from harzburgite on the basis of wave speeds, but its \&SIM;6\% greater density may render it detectable through gravity measurements. Subducted hydrous crust in cold slabs can persist to several gigapascals at seismic velocities that are several percent slower than the surrounding mantle. Seismic velocities and V-P/V-S ratios indicate that mantle wedges locally reach 60-80\% hydration.",

	abstract = "[1] The amount of {H$_2$O} subducted to postarc depths dictates such disparate factors as the generation of arc and back-arc magmas, the rheology of the mantle wedge and slab, and the global circulation of {H$_2$O}. Perple\_X was used to calculate phase diagrams and rock physical properties for pressures of 0.5-4.0 GPa and temperatures of 300-900 degrees C for a range of bulk compositions appropriate to subduction zones. These data were merged with global subduction zone rock fluxes to generate a model for global {H$_2$O} flux to postarc depths. For metasomatized igneous rocks, subducted {H$_2$O} scales with bulk rock K2O in hot slabs. Metasomatized ultramafic rocks behave similarly in cold slabs, but in hot slabs carry no {H$_2$O} to magma generation depths because they lack K2O. Chert and carbonate are responsible for minimal {H$_2$O} subduction, whereas clay-rich and terrigenous sediments stabilize several hydrous phases at low temperature, resulting in significant postarc slab {H$_2$O} flux in cold and hot slabs. Continental crust also subducts much {H$_2$O} in cold slabs because of the stability of lawsonite and phengite; in hot slabs it is phengite that carries the bulk of this {H$_2$O} to postarc depth. All told, the postarc flux of {H$_2$O} in cold slabs is dominated by terrigenous sediment and the igneous lower crust and mantle and is proportional to bulk rock {H$_2$O}. In contrast, in hot slabs the major contributors of postarc slab {H$_2$O} are metasomatized volcanic rocks and subducted continental crust, with the amount of postarc slab {H$_2$O} scaling with K2O. The Andes and Java-Sumatra-Andaman slabs are the principal suppliers of pelagic and terrigenous sediment hosted {H$_2$O} to postarc depths, respectively. The Chile and Solomon arcs contribute the greatest {H$_2$O} flux from subducted continental and oceanic forearc, respectively. The Andean arc has the greatest {H$_2$O} flux provided through subduction of hydrated ocean crust and mantle. No correlation was observed between postarc slab {H$_2$O} flux and slab seismicity.",

We apply time-domain waveform cross-correlation for P and S waves between each event and 100 neighboring events identified from the catalog based on a 3D velocity model. To simplify the computation, we first divide southern California into five polygons, such that there are similar to 100,000 events or less in each region. The polygon boundaries are chosen to lie in regions of sparse seismicity. We calculate and save differential times from the peaks in the cross-correlation functions and use a spline interpolation method to achieve a nominal timing precision of 0.001 sec. These differential times, together with existing P- and S-phase picks, are input to the double-difference program of Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2000, 2002) to calculate refined hypocenters. We divide the southern California region into grid cells and successively relocate hypocenters within each grid cell. The overall resulting pattern of seismicity is more focused than the previously determined pattern from 1D or 3D models. The new improved locations are more clustered, in many cases by a factor of two or three, and often show clear linear alignments. In particular, the depth distribution is improved and less affected by layer boundaries in velocity models or other similar artifacts.",

	abstract = "The first similar to 600 million years of Earth history ( the 'Hadean' eon) remain poorly understood, largely because there is no rock record dating from that era. Detrital Hadean igneous zircons from the Jack Hills(1), Western Australia, however, can potentially provide insights into the conditions extant on our planet at that time. Results of geochemical investigations(2-13) using these ancient grains have been interpreted to suggest the presence of a hydrosphere(2-4,7,8) and continental crust(9,10) before 4Gyr. An underexploited characteristic of the >4 Gyr zircons is their diverse assemblage of mineral inclusions(14-17). Here we present an examination of over 400 Hadean zircons from Jack Hills, which shows that some inclusion assemblages are conducive to thermobarometry. Our thermobarometric analyses of 4.02 - 4.19- Gyr- old inclusion- bearing zircons constrain their magmatic formation conditions to about 700 degrees C and 7 kbar. This result implies a near- surface heat flow of similar to 75 mW m(-2), about three to five times lower than estimates of Hadean global heat flow. As the only site of magmatism on modern Earth that is characterized by heat flow of about one- quarter of the global average is above subduction zones, we suggest that the magmas from which the Jack Hills Hadean zircons crystallized were formed largely in an under thrust environment, perhaps similar to modern convergent margins.",

Most of them were not found within the subducting Pacific plate with a few exceptions. Moreover, even on the plate boundary, they were not located in the large moment release areas of large interplate earthquakes that occurred recently or in the areas where the plates are inferred to be strongly coupled from GPS data analyses. These observations suggest that these similar earthquakes are caused by repeating slips of small asperities with a dimension of around 0.1 to 1 km surrounded by stable sliding areas on the plate boundary. If the aseismic slip portion in these small asperities is negligible, we can estimate the cumulative amount of aseismic slip in the area surrounding each asperity. In other words, repeating earthquake data potentially can be used to estimate the spatiotemporal aseismic slip distribution on the plate boundary. We estimated the spatial distribution of slip rate on the plate boundary from repeating earthquake data. The scaling relation between seismic moment and seismic slip by Nadeau and Johnson [1998] is used for the estimation of the slip amount by each repeating earthquake cluster. Obtained spatial distribution is consistent with that estimated from GPS data on land.",

	abstract = "A study of the tendency of deep and shallow earthquakes in the Fiji-Tonga-Kermadec region to cluster in space and time revealed that (a) in general, deep earthquakes do not form either aftershock sequences of swarms of the types commonly observed in series of shallow shocks throughout the world; (b) a small percentage of the deep earthquakes cluster in the form of multiplets, i.e., small numbers of events closely grouped in space and time; and (c) during the 7-year interval studied, clustering of the shallow events in the Kermadec region was markedly greater than that of shallow events in the Tongan region; clustering of shallow events in the Tongan area was, in turn, greater than that of the deep shocks in the Fijian region. The data provide new constraints for hypotheses of focal mechanisms. Most deep multiplets were doublets, and in no case were more than 12 events observed per multiplet. Resolution of the analysis was sufficient to show that, in the case of at least one multiplet, separation between events was smaller than 2 km, but that in other cases it was larger than 5 km. Separations between events in time were sometimes smaller than 2 seconds, but in no case was the relation in time and space such that a later event of a multiplet could not have been dependent upon an earlier event, i.e., the time between events was greater than that required for seismic wave propagation between the two foci. A narrow linear feature about 60 km long is defined by a spatially progressive sequence of deep multiplets that were observed during 1965. These deep multiplets are also confined to a narrow range of depths between about 625 and 660 km. This feature seems to form a portion of the lower edge of the narrow inclined zone of deep earthquakes. Patterns of first motions radiated from earthquakes in the linear feature are generally similar to one another and are in agreement with a model of the source corresponding to a double-couple or shear dislocation. Variations among the radiation patterns, although minor, are distinct and indicate some heterogeneity in the detailed distribution of stress. The data of this study do not support the hypothesis of a volumetric phase change as the mechanism of the deep-focus earthquakes. Although there is no existing hypothesis that does predict completely the results determined here, the data appear to agree best with the mechanism proposed by Orowan. A significant source of data for this work is a new network of five seismograph stations now operating in Fiji and Tonga. This study, under the U.S. Upper Mantle Program, is part of a more comprehensive investigation of deep earthquakes in the region."

The double-couple model is an adequate representation for earthquake mechanisms at all depths; most of the mechanisms are characterized by a predominance of dip-slip motions. The orientations of the mechanisms of deep and shallow earthquakes appear to be systematically and fundamentally different in respect to the orientation of the seismic zone. Whereas the shallow mechanisms all appear to accommodate movements between the adjacent sides of the seismic zone, the slip planes of the deep earthquake mechanisms are systematically nonparallel to the deep seismic zone. Hence, the deep zone of activity does not appear to be a simple thrust fault. The P, B, and T axes of the double-couple solutions tend to parallel the dip, strike, and normal directions, respectively, of the portions of the Tonga seismic zone deeper than about 80 km. The P axes tend to be more stable in orientation than the B and T axes. Large variations in the orientations of some of the deep mechanisms may reflect contortions of the deep seismic zone in a simple geometrical fashion. The shallow mechanisms indicate that thrust faulting is occurring beneath the inner (islandward) margins of the Tonga and Kermadec Trenches and that transform faulting is occurring at the northern end of the Tonga Arc. The over-all interpretation of the shallow mechanisms also includes hinge faulting south of Samoa at the juncture of the thrust and transform faults. These results, which are also in agreement with mechanism data for other regions such as Japan where both numerous and reliable data are available, are most simply interpreted by a tectonic model of an island arc in which (a) shallow earthquakes occur between a segment of lithosphere that moves downward into the mantle and the segments of lithosphere on the surface, and (b) deep earthquakes occur within the downgoing slab in response to a compressional stress within it.

	abstract = {Using the peri-Mediterranean blueschist belts as a case study we discuss the mechanisms of syn-orogenic exhumation of high-pressure (HP) and ultra-high-pressure (UHP) rocks. The Mediterranean examples, within an overall convergent zone, show variations in the rates of convergence, rates of slab retreat, available space, and various stages of maturation of accretionary complexes. After a compilation of the deformation history and the kinematic boundary conditions and their evolution through time, we discuss P-T-t paths. Most of the structures found in the field today relate to the exhumation stage and often to quite superficial events related to syn-orogenic detachments. However a significant vertical motion occurred from the depth of eclogites (or UHP eclogites) to the depth of the blueschist or greenschist facies along cold P-T paths. Two types of mountain belts are described: those where a single thermal gradient was recorded throughout its' history, like the Franco-Italian Alps, which suggest a steady state evolution; and those where the thermal gradient has changed through time (and space), such as the Aegean region, which suggest a non-steady-state evolution. Slab retreat within a subduction. complex does not lead to the exhumation of UHP rocks because the open subduction channel allows for fast circulation and detachment of sediments from the subducting basement. Subducted sediments lubricate the subduction channel and the basement is thus not involved in the return flow. Early exhumation is fast and the thermal regime in the subduction channel is partly controlled by the velocity of convergence and the velocity of slab retreat as well as by the nature of the subducted material. Final exhumation occurs within the accretionary complex at a much slower rate below extensional detachments. The removal of the overburden is achieved primarily by extension in the upper part of the accretionary complex. Extensional faults and shear zones are rooted in the brittle-ductile transition of the accretionary complex. Deeper "extensional" shear zones result from shearing along the base of the upper plate. We discuss a model with several levels of circulation of subducted material and compare it with available thermo-mechanical models.},

Given reasonable H2O abundances in Earth’s mantle, an H2O-rich fluid could exist only in a region defined by the wet solidus and thermal stability limits of hydrous minerals, at depths between 90 and 330 kilometers. The experimental partial melts monotonously became more mafic with increasing pressure from andesitic composition at 1 gigapascal to more mafic than the starting peridotite at 10 gigapascals. Because the chemistry of the experimental partial melts is similar to that of kimberlites, it is suggested that kimberlites may be derived by low-temperature melting of an H2O-rich mantle at depths of 150 to 300 kilometers.",

	abstract = "[1] We examined dozens of aftershock sequences in Hawaii in terms of Gutenberg-Richter and modified Omori law parameters. We studied p, the rate of aftershock decay; A(p), the aftershock productivity, defined as the observed divided by the expected number of aftershocks; and c, the time delay when aftershock rates begin to fall. We found that for earthquakes shallower than 20 km, p values > 1.2 are near active magma centers. We associate this high decay rate with higher temperatures and faster stress relaxation near magma reservoirs. Deep earthquakes near Kilauea's inferred magma transport path show a range of p values, suggesting the absence of a large, deep magma reservoir. Aftershock productivity is > 4.0 for flank earthquakes known to be triggered by intrusions but is normal (0.25 to 4.0) for isolated main shocks. We infer that continuing, post-main shock stress from the intrusion adds to the main shock's stress step and causes higher A(p). High A(p) in other zones suggests less obvious intrusions and pulsing magma pressure near Kilauea's feeding conduit. We calculate stress rates and stress rate changes from pre-main shock and aftershock rates. Stress rate increased after many intrusions but decreased after large M7 - 8 earthquakes. Stress rates are highest in the seismically active volcano flanks and lowest in areas far from volcanic centers. We found sequences triggered by intrusions tend to have high A(p), high (> 0.10 day) c values, a stress rate increase, and sometimes a peak in aftershock rate hours after the main shock. We interpret these values as indicating continuing intrusive stress after the main shock.",

During heating, the serpentine-bearing rocks showed a sudden decrease in V, at 600-700 degrees C when serpentine dehydration took place. Similarly, the chlorite-bearing rocks exhibited a sharp change in V, at 800-900 degrees C due to chlorite dehydration. During cooling experiments on both serpentine- and chlorite-bearing rocks, Vp showed a linear increase down to room temperature, suggesting that no rehydration reaction took place with decreasing temperature. The decrease in V, clue to dehydration reactions was relatively small (<= 1.5\%) in rocks with low {H$_2$O} content (0.2-1.3 wt.\%), whereas the dehydration reaction of serpentinized dunite with higher (4.1 wt.\%) {H$_2$O} led to a marked decrease in V-p (-5.1\%), which is comparable to the degree of V, reduction reported from the low-velocity anomaly regions in subducting slabs. The effect of (H)2O fluid on the V, of peridotite is evaluated by assessing the ratio of V-p values (V-p/V-p(0)) under both wet and dry conditions. The V-p/V-p(0) ratio was 0.97-0.99 in rocks with 0.2-1.3 wt.\% {H$_2$O}, but was markedly lower in rocks with 4.1 wt.\% {H$_2$O} (0.87). The run products showed variable geometries of fluid-filled pores, which clearly depended on the {H$_2$O} content of the rock studied. The run products with 0.2-1.3 wt.\% {H$_2$O} had relatively small and isolated fluid-filled pores, whereas run products with 4.1 wt.\% {H$_2$O} contained relatively large fluid-filled pores that were interconnected. Our results suggest that connected fluid-filled pores cause a significant decrease in Vp, but that isolated fluid-pores have little effect on V-p. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

All available epicentral distance ranges of seismic rays are considered. All sources are relocated using an algorithm, which includes the double-difference method. In addition, source parameters are corrected in the main inversion step, simultaneously with the velocity models. The high reliability of the resulting P-velocity images is confirmed by various tests. The S model provides much smoother patterns, which are, however, generally consistent with P anomalies. Our model shows a complex image of lithospheric plate under the study region. Under SW Hindukush, the northwards subducting Indian plate is imaged throughout the upper mantle and transition zone. Further to the NE, within a 300-km-wide zone the upper part of the plate overturns and then the slab breaks off after it narrows at similar to 250 km depth. The tomographic model also provides evidence for the southward subduction of the lithosphere beneath the southern Tien Shan down to at least 250 km depth. To the north of Tarim, we observe a northward-dipping of the Tarim plate down to similar to 500 km depth. At the crustal depth our model shows alternating belts of high and low velocities parallel to the main thrusting faults, which indicate complex crustal structure in this region.",

	abstract = "The 2002 seismicity of Mt Hochstaufen, SE Germany, is characterized by several swarm-type earthquake sequences that follow above-average rainfall events. First investigations have recently provided indication, that the rain events triggered this swarm-type activity. We present a detailed relocation of the 2002 seismicity, which is composed of (1) cluster analysis, (2) multievent semi-automatic phase repicking, (3) probabilistic location in a pseudo-3-D velocity model with topography and (4) master event relocation. Furthermore, focal mechanisms of selected events are derived by taking into account the first-motion polarities of P, SV and SH waves. We introduce a simple methodology to test the stability and estimate the variance of the focal mechanisms solutions. Location uncertainties of less than 100 m were achieved. The hypocentres are mainly concentrated between 1000 m above and 4000 m below sea level and aligned on two planes, which, however, cannot be associated with geological structures with reasonable certainty. Swarm-type activity follows above-average rain events and shows a depth migration of hypocentres over time. Evidence that the rain events triggered the earthquake swarms is reported by Hainzl et al. on basis of our relocation. The derived focal mechanisms seem to indicate an influence of the Saalachtal Fault Zone on the stress regime of the study area.",

	abstract = "U-Pb ages of titanite and rutile were obtained from the central Western Gneiss Region, Norway, to assess the style and timing of exhumation and cooling of the Western Gneiss UHP terrane. Approximately half of the titanite ages are concordant, the majority of which yield a limited age range from 393 to 390 Ma. The other titanite data are discordant, and define discordia arrays with upper intercept ages of either similar to 938 Ma or similar to 1.6 Ga, and a lower interceptof similar to 389 Ma. Concordant rutile analyses range from 385 to 392 Ma. Both titanite and rutile ages young WNW toward the core of the orogen and are similar to 4 Ma older than Ar-40/Ar-39 muscovite ages, corresponding to a cooling rate of similar to 90 degrees C/Ma. A well-defined boundary between concordant and discordant titanite ages, in combination with the WNW-increasing P-T gradient and the similarity between muscovite cooling ages in the east and eclogite ages in the west, suggests that the WGR remained coherent throughout its exhumation history, and was progressively unroofed from east to west.A390.2 +/- 0.8 Ma titanite in the Soroyane UHP domain indicates that exhumation occurred at a vertical rate of similar to 7 mm/yr for similar to 12 Ma. These rates are slower than estimates from smaller UHP terranes, but similar to other large UHP terranes, suggesting that there may be fundamental differences in the mechanisms controlling the evolution of large UHP terranes that undergo protracted subduction and exhumation, and smaller UHP terranes that undergo rapid subduction and exhumation.

The methods are (1) the hypocentroidal decomposition method of Jordan and Sverdrup (1981), (2) the source-specific station term method (SSST) of Richards-Dinger and Shearer (2000), and (3) the modified double-difference method (DD) of Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2000). We generate a set of synthetic earthquakes, stations, and arrival time picks in half-space velocity models. We simulate the effect of travel time variations caused by random picking errors, station terms, and general three-dimensional velocity structure. We implement the algorithms with a common linearized approach and solve the systems using a conjugate gradient method. We constrain the mean location shift to be zero for the hypocentroidal decomposition and double-difference locations. For a single compact cluster of events, these three methods yield very similar improvements in relative location accuracy. For distributed seismicity, the DD and SSST algorithms both provide improved relative locations of comparable accuracy. We also present a new location technique, termed the shrinking box SSST method, which provides some improvement in absolute location accuracy compared to the SSST method. In our implementation of these algorithms, the SSST method runs significantly faster than the DD method.",

The calculated values of cell volume at different pressures and temperatures are compatible with experiments. The results calculated by LDA are more concordant with the experimental results than those by GGA for describing Mg(2)SA crystals.

	abstract = "Using a recently developed petrogenetic grid for MORB+{H$_2$O}, we propose a new model for the transportation of water from the subducting slab into the mantle transition zone. Depending on the geothermal gradient, two contrasting water-transportation mechanisms operate at depth in a subduction zone. If the geothermal gradient is low, lawsonite carries {H$_2$O} into mantle depths of 300 km; with further subduction down to the mantle transition depth (approximately 400 km) lawsonite is no longer stable and thereafter {H$_2$O} is once migrated upward to the mantle wedge then again carried down to the transition zone due to the induced convection. At this depth, hydrous beta-phase olivine is stable and plays a role as a huge water reservoir. In contrast, if the geothermal gradient is high, the subducted slab may melt at 700-900 degrees C at depths shallower than 80 km to form felsic melt, into which water is dissolved. In this case, {H$_2$O} cannot be transported into the mantle below 80 km. Between these two end-member mechanisms, two intermediate types are present. In the high-pressure intermediate type, the hydrous phase A plays an important role to carry water into the mantle transition zone. Water liberated by the lawsonite-consuming continuous reaction moves upward to form hydrous phase A in the hanging wall, which transports water into deeper mantle. This is due to a unique character of the reaction, because Phase A can become stable through the hydration reaction of olivine. In the case of low-pressure intermediate type, the presence of a dry mantle wedge below 100 km acts as a barrier to prevent {H$_2$O} from entering into deeper mantle.

Since V-s is principally controlled by temperature, rather than by composition, it can be used to map the lithospheric thickness. Extensive regions of thick lithosphere underlie some, but not all, cratons. Conversely, thick lithosphere underlies some platforms and belts of active deformation. Because of this lack of correspondence, and because their age cannot be determined from seismology, we refer to regions of thick lithosphere as 'cores' rather than 'cratons'. The shape of such cores has controlled the geometry of continental deformation and the distribution of diamond-bearing kimberlites. The strength of the cores resides in the dry crust, which is insulated from the hot convecting mantle by the thick buoyant lithosphere. The most surprising feature is the presence of thick lithosphere beneath Tibet and Iran, whose velocity structure closely resembles that of the cores beneath cratons, though they have a thicker hotter crust. Tibet and Iran appear to be places where cratons are now being formed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The study concentrates on parts of the northern Alpine foreland where many earthquakes occur inside the laminated lower crust, which is generally considered to be warm and weak. Thin mafic/ultramafic, sill-like intrusions and invisible dykes are assumed to form a corset-like network with high strength. This model can explain the observed strong and multiple reflections and the occurrence of rupture inside a stable structure within a weak lower crust. Tectonic stress transfer (from the Alpine collision zone or/and the Upper Rhine Graben) and its release may follow classical friction concepts. In addition, the heterogeneity of the laminated lower crust may also favour various viscous instabilities. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We present a way of visualizing double-difference data, and use it to show how differential arrival-time data can, in principle, be used to determine the absolute locations of earthquakes. We then analyze the differential form of Geiger's Method, which is the basis of many double-difference earthquake-location algorithms, and show that it can be used to make estimates of the absolute location of earthquake sources. Finally, we examine absolute-location error in one earthquake-location scenario, using Monte Carlo simulations that include both measurement error and velocity model error, and show that the double-difference method produces absolute locations with errors that are comparable in magnitude, or even less, than traditional methods. The improvement in absolute locations arises from exactly the same, and often-cited, reasons that the double-difference method yields superior relative locations: observations of differential travel times determined via cross correlation have a much smaller error than observations of absolute travel times determined via phase picking; and predictions of differential travel times are less sensitive to unmodeled near-surface heterogeneity than are predictions of absolute travel times. Absolute earthquake locations that are already routinely produced by most implementations of the double-difference method have a better accuracy than has been credited.},

The velocity structure determines the ray paths between hypocenters and receivers. These ray paths, and the corresponding ray take-off angles at the hypocenters, determine the partial derivatives of travel time with respect to the hypocentral coordinates which form the inversion kernel that maps double-differences into hypocentral perturbations. Thus the large-scale velocity structure enters into the core of the double-difference technique. By employing a 1D layered model with sharp interfaces to perform double-difference inversion of synthetic data generated using a simple, 1D gradient model; we show that inappropriate choice of the velocity model, combined with unbalanced source-receiver distributions, can lead to significant distortion and bias in the relative hypocenter positions of closely spaced events.",

	abstract = "In strike-slip fault systems, Coulomb failure stress changes due to mainshocks can trigger large aftershocks or further earthquakes. The combination of static stress changes from mainshocks and large aftershocks potentially has a profound influence on the final distribution of aftershocks and crustal-scale fluid redistribution. Because mineralization acts as a high fluid flux indicator the interaction of static stress changes, fault triggering and fluid flow can be studied from mineralized fossil fault systems. Two examples are presented from separate fault systems in the Kalgoorlie greenstone terrane, Western Australia (the Black Flag and Boulder-Lefroy Fault systems). Using mapped fault geometries, slip directions and the known distribution of fault-hosted gold mineralization we show that the repeated arrest of mainshock ruptures, at both dilational and contractional fault step-overs, controlled aftershock-related fluid flow. Importantly, the largest aftershocks or subsequent triggered earthquakes exerted a very strong control on where the highest fluid fluxes occurred through small-event aftershock fault networks (at distances up to similar to 15 kin away from the step-overs). Fluid flow through mid-crustal fault systems in crystalline rock is spatially localised in regions where repeated clusters of aftershocks cause permeability enhancement. It is dependent on the seismogenic behaviour of the system, rather than a passive exploitation of the internal structure and fabrics developed by faults or damage zones. Field evidence implies that high pore fluid factors were repeatedly attained in the aftershock-related mineralized faults and that the fluids were derived from deep-level, overpressured reservoirs, rather than local wall rock porosity. It is apparent that high-pressure fluids, possibly released in a pulse after a mainshock, contribute to the rupture of structures already promoted towards failure from static stress changes.

The large-aperture array consisted of seven stations with three-component mid-period seismometers, and independently triggered prototype PASSCAL data recorders with GOES clocks. The array spatial distribution and the synchronized data have permitted us to employ simple beamforming operations to improve receiver-function estimation from single teleseismic events. The beamforming reinforces the coherent teleseismic P wave and the deterministic portions of the P-wave coda, primarily generated by interactions at major lithospheric interfaces. Microseismic background noise is incoherent across the array, and is attenuated by beamforming. Beamforming also diminishes those portions of the coda due to scattering by inhomogeneities, that appear random on the scale of the array aperture. The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio of the teleseismic recording dramatically improves the single-event receiver function deconvolution results.",

Results of preliminary experiments to clarify the effect of water on kinetics of the olivine-wadsleyite transformation are given, and show that water enhances the transformation kinetics significantly.|There are potential dehydration sites in the deep mantle; four sites along the descending slabs depending on their temperature profiles, i.e., the mantle wedge of the subduction zone, mantle transition zone, top of the lower mantle where hydrous ringwoodite and superhydrous phase B decompose, and deep in the lower mantle around 1200-1500 km depth where decomposition of phase D(G) occurs. We also expect one site of dehydration melting at the base of the upper mantle where the hot mantle plume hydrated in the transition zone can be dehydrated. The transition zone can serve as a water absorber for the mantle scale water circulation system.|Some of the recent seismic works including the P-wave tomography images reveal the existence of low velocity anomalies in the transition zone suggesting possibly a wet transition zone. Elevation of the 4 10 km discontinuity and lack of clear evidence for a metastable olivine wedge in cold slabs may be consistent with the equilibrium phase transformation from olivine to wadsleyite in cold and wet slabs on the basis of our kinetic study of the transformation under wet conditions.

Thus, the transition zone may be a major water reservoir in the Earth's interior. Recent geophysical observations suggest the existence of the hydrated transition zone beneath subduction zones.

	abstract = "A shallow M6.4 inland earthquake occurred on 26 July 2003 in the northern part of Miyagi Prefecture, northeastern Japan. This earthquake was a typical inland thrust earthquake, a type that is common in NE Japan. We obtained a detailed seismic velocity structure in the focal area of this earthquake by the double-difference tomography method. Arrival-time data came from temporary seismic stations deployed above the mainshock fault plane. Both the P-wave and S-wave velocities in the hanging wall were lower than those in the footwall. Aftershocks were aligned along a zone where the seismic velocity changes rapidly. This is consistent with the interpretation that the 2003 northern Miyagi earthquake occurred along a fault that acted as a normal fault in the Miocene and has been reactivated as a reverse fault under the present compressional stress regime. The large slip area by the main shock rupture (asperity) corresponds to an area with relatively high P- and S-wave velocities. A zone with low V-p/V-s was detected along the aftershock area. One of the possible causes of this low-V-p/V-s zone is the existence of high-aspect-ratio pores that contain water. Hypocenters of the main shock, largest foreshock, and largest aftershock are also located within the low-Vp/Vs zone. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Bull Seism Soc Am 93 (2003) 1875-1889.]. We inverted arrival times recorded by a dense temporary seismic network for aftershocks and seismic networks routinely operated by Japanese Universities. Obtained results are summarized as follows: (1) Low-velocity zones of a few kilometers' width are distributed along the fault or along the aftershock alignment, suggesting that the fault of the 1995 earthquake is located primarily in a low-velocity zone. (2) Amount of velocity decrease within this low-velocity zone varies along the strike of the fault. Most of large slip areas (asperities) seem to correspond to higher velocity areas relative to the surroundings on the fault, rather than to lower velocity areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = "Previous work has suggested that many of the deep earthquakes beneath the Fiji Basin occur in slab material that has been detached and foundered to the bottom of the transition zone or has been laid down by trench migration in a similar recumbent position. Since nowhere else in the Earth do so many earthquakes occur in slabs stagnated in the transition zone, these earthquakes merit closer study. Accordingly, we have assembled from historical and modern data a comprehensive catalogue of the relocated hypocenters and focal mechanisms of well-located deep events in the geographic area between the bottoms of the main Vanuatu and Tonga Wadati-Benioff zones. Two regions of deep seismogenesis are recognized there: (i) 163 deep shocks have occurred north of 15 degrees S in the Vityaz Group from 1949 to 1996. These seismological observations and the absence of other features characteristic of active subduction suggest that the Vityaz group represents deep Failure in a detached slab that has foundered to a horizontal orientation near the bottom of the transition zone. (ii) Another group of nearly 50 'outboard' deep shocks occur between about 450 and 660 km depth, west of the complexly buckled and offset western edge of the Tonga Wadati-Benioff zone. Their geometry is in the form of two or possibly three small-circle arcs that roughly parallel the inferred motion of Tonga trench migration. Earthquakes in the southernmost of these arcs occur in a recumbent high-seismic-wavespeed slab anomaly that connects both to the main inclined Tonga anomaly to the east and a lower mantle anomaly to the west [Van der Hilst, R., 1995. Complex morphology of subducted lithosphere in the mantle beneath the Tonga trench. Nature, Vol. 374, pp. 154-157.]. Both groups show complexity in their focal mechanisms. The major question raised by these observations is the cause of this apparent temporary arrest in the descent of the Tonga slab into the lower mantle. We approach these questions by considering the effects of buoyant metastable peridotite in cold slab material that was detached and rapidly foundered, or was buckled, segmented and laid out in the transition zone.

	abstract = "[1] Rupture velocity is an important source parameter, which is often difficult to determine, especially for deep-focus earthquakes where there is usually limited near-source information. To help overcome this problem, we developed a new method to estimate rupture velocities of deep-focus earthquakes with better resolution. We first carry out teleseismic P waveform inversions to determine slip distributions for a range of rupture velocities on the two nodal planes. Then forward modeling of regional data is performed using the slip distributions determined in the teleseismic inversions to estimate the rupture velocity. Using this method, we attempted to determine the rupture velocities of large deep-focus earthquakes surrounding Japan, which are well recorded on teleseismic and regional networks. Empirical Green functions are used for both the teleseismic and regional analyses. Although it is difficult to determine the rupture velocity from only the teleseismic data, the analyses including regional data show clear difference which can resolve the rupture velocity and fault geometry. For three deep earthquakes, we obtained rupture velocities of about 1 similar to 2 km/s, which correspond to 20 similar to 40\% of the shear wave velocity and are much slower than typical values for shallow earthquakes.",

In steady-state subduction zones with moderate rates of shear heating, most of the subducting oceanic crust passes through the blueschist [-\&gt;] eclogite transition. In steady-state subduction zones with low rates of shear heating, the entire subducting oceanic crust lies within the blueschist facies to depths greater than 70 km. For oceanic crust containing 1-2 wt\% H2O, dehydration will not begin until the onset of eclogite- or amphibolite-facies metamorphism, depending on the P-T path. For many subduction zones, the most important dehydration reactions in the subducting oceanic crust occur at the blueschist [-\&gt;] eclogite facies transition associated with the breakdown of lawsonite (or clinozoisite), glaucophane, and chlorite. Large amounts of H2O released by blueschist [-\&gt;] eclogite dehydration reactions could trigger partial melting in the overlying mantle wedge and may play a crucial role in the generation of arc magmas.

Lower plane earthquakes occur at similar to 550-800 degreesC at 100 km depth and at similar to 350-600 degreesC at 160 km depth. These conditions coincide with the dehydration reaction antigorite (serpentine) --> forsterite + enstatite + {H$_2$O}, which suggests that lower plane earthquakes may be triggered by dehydration embrittlement, which in turn suggests that the subducting oceanic mantle is partially hydrated, Serpentinization may occur in the trench-outer rise region, where faulting may promote infiltration of seawater several tens of kilometers into the oceanic lithosphere.

	abstract = "This paper is concerned with the implications of earthquake depth distributions in the Himalayan-Tibetan collision zone for the general understanding of lithosphere rheology. In particular, recent studies have argued that microearthquakes in the uppermost mantle beneath Nepal and some earthquakes at 80-90 km depth, close to the Moho in SE and NW Tibet, reinforce the conventional view of the last 25 yr that the continental lithosphere is well represented by strong seismogenic layers in the upper crust and uppermost mantle, separated by a weak and aseismic lower crust. That view was recently challenged by an alternative one suggesting that the continental lithosphere contained a single strong seismogenic layer, that was either the upper crust or the whole crust, but did not involve the mantle. We re-examine the seismic structure and seismicity of the Himalayan-Tibetan collision zone, recalculating earthquake depths in velocity structures that are consistent with seismic receiver functions and surface wave dispersion studies, and calculating a geotherm for the Indian Shield consistent with kimberlite nodule geochemistry. Earthquakes occur throughout the crustal thickness of the Indian Shield, where the lower crust is thought to consist of dry granulite, responsible for its seismogenic behaviour and strength as manifested by its relatively large effective elastic thickness. The crust of the Indian Shield is thin (similar to 35 km) for an Archean shield, and this, in turn, leads to a steady-state Moho temperature that could be as low as similar to 500 degrees C. When this shield is thrust beneath the Himalaya in Nepal, the relatively low mantle temperature, together with the high strain rates associated with it adopting a 'ramp-and-flat' geometry, may be responsible for the mantle microearthquakes that accompany other earthquakes in the lower crust. Further north, the upper crust of India south of the Indus Suture Zone has been removed, the uppermost lower crust of India has heated up, and seismicity is restricted to a few earthquakes very close to the Moho at 80-90 km, where errors in Moho and earthquake depth determinations make it unclear whether these events are in the crust or mantle. A similar situation exists in NW Tibet beneath the Kunlun, where earthquakes at 80-90 km depth occur very close to the Moho. Both places are about 400 km north of the Himalayan front, and we suspect both represent the minimum distance India has underthrust Tibet, so that India underlies most of the SE and nearly all of the NW Tibetan plateau. The distribution of earthquake depths throughout the region is consistent with a generic global view of seismicity in which earthquakes occur in (1) 'wet' upper crustal material to a temperature of similar to 350 degrees C, or (2) higher temperatures in dry granulite-facies lower crust or (3) mantle that is colder than similar to 600 degrees C.",

The latter can supply locations ten to a hundred times more precise than traditional methods. Since good locations of seismic sources are needed as the starting point for so many user communities, and potentially can be provided due to current improvements in easily-accessible computational capability, we advocate wide-scale application of modern methods in the routine production of bulletins of seismicity.

Innovations in the technique include (1) the use of eigenspectral methods for cross-spectral phase estimation and for providing subsample pick lag error estimates in units of time, as opposed to dimensionless relative scaling of uncertainties; (2) adaptive, cross-coherency-based filtering; and (3) a hierarchical waveform stack correlation method for adjusting mean intercluster pick times without compromising tight intracluster relative pick estimates. To solve the systems of cross-correlation lags we apply an iterative, optimized conjugate gradient technique that minimizes an L-1-norm misfit. Our repicking technique not only provides robust similarity classification-event discrimination without making a priori assumptions regarding waveform similarity as a function of preliminary hypocenter estimates, but also facilitates high-resolution relocation of seismic sources. Although knowledgeable user input is needed initially to establish run-time parameters, significant improvement in pick consistency and waveform-based event classification may be obtained by then allowing the programs to operate automatically on the data. The process shows promise for enhancing catalog reliability while at the same time reducing analyst workload, although careful assessment of the automatic results is still important.",

In a non-double-couple treatment that considers non-negligible non-elastic contributions to the earthquake phenomena, only a nearly vertical fault can explain both high values of seismic moment and the approximate to 3.0 mas (approximate to 10 cm) polhody displacement toward an azimuth exactly opposite to the epicentre azimuth. Case-histories of great earthquakes are then reviewed to highlight the overall analogies. The similarity of the vertical displacements shown by these earthquakes (Chile 1960, Alaska 1964, ...) leads to a common interpretation necessitating resort to a prevailing uprising of lithospheric material. This interpretation is supported by the inspection of the irregularities of the hypocentre-distribution along the Wadati-Benioff zones. Moreover, in the case of great South American earthquakes, a volcanic eruptions-earthquakes correlation is clearly recognisable. A thorough revision of the pure elastic rebound model of great earthquakes occurrence and a complete overcoming of the large scale subduction concept is then needed.",

	abstract = "A new model for the earliest stages in the evolution of subduction zones is developed from recent geologic studies of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) arc system and then applied to Late Jurassic ophiolites of Cailfornia. The model accounts for several key observations about the earliest stages in the evolution of the IBM system: (1) subduction nucleated along an active transform boundary, which separated younger, less-dense lithosphere in the west from older, more-dense lithosphere to the east; (2) initial arc magmatic activity occupied a much broader zone than existed later; (3) initial magmatism extended up to the modern trench, over a region now characterized by subnormal heat flow; (4) early are magmatism was characterized by depleted (tholeiitic) and ultra-depleted (boninitic) magmas, indicating that melting was more extensive and involved more depleted mantle than is found anywhere else on earth; (5) early arc magmatism was strongly extensional, with crust forming in a manner similar to slow-spreading ridges; and (6) crust production rates were 120 to 180 km3/km-Ma, several times greater than for mature arc systems. These observations require that the earliest stages of subduction involve rapid retreat of the trench; we infer that this resulted from continuous subsidence of denser lithosphere along the transform fault. This resulted in strong extension and thinning of younger, more buoyant lithosphere to the west. This extension was accompanied by the flow of water from the sinking oceanic lithosphere to the base of the extending lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere. Addition of water and asthenospheric upwelling led to catastrophic melting, which continued until lithosphere subsidence was replaced by lithospheric subduction. Application of the subduction-zone infancy model to the Late Jurassic ophiolites of California provides a framework in which to understand the rapid formation of oceanic crust with strong arc affinities between the younger Sierran magmatic arc and the Franciscan subduction complex, provides a mechanism for the formation and subsidence of the Great Valley forearc basin, and explains the limited duration of high-T, high-P metamorphism experienced by Franciscan melanges.

	abstract = "Earthquake location using relative arrival time measurements can lead to dramatically reduced location errors and a view of fault-zone processes with unprecedented detail. There are two principal reasons why this approach reduces location errors. The first is that the use of differenced arrival times to solve for the vector separation of earthquakes removes from the earthquake location problem much of the error due to unmodeled velocity structure. The second reason, on which we focus in this article, is that waveform cross correlation can substantially reduce measurement error. While cross correlation has long been used to determine relative arrival times with subsample precision, we extend correlation measurements to less similar waveforms, and we introduce a general quantitative means to assess when correlation data provide an improvement over catalog phase picks. We apply the technique to local earthquake data from the Calaveras Fault in northern California. Tests for an example streak of 243 earthquakes demonstrate that relative arrival times with normalized cross correlation coefficients as low as similar to70\%, interevent separation distances as large as to 2 km, and magnitudes up to 3.5 as recorded on the Northern California Seismic Network are more precise than relative arrival times determined from catalog phase data. Also discussed are improvements made to the correlation technique itself. We find that for large time offsets, our implementation of time-domain cross correlation is often more robust and that it recovers more observations than the cross spectral approach. Longer time windows give better results than shorter ones. Finally, we explain how thresholds and empirical weighting functions may be derived to optimize the location procedure for any given region of interest, taking advantage of the respective strengths of diverse correlation and catalog phase data on different length scales.",

Correlated earthquakes are earthquakes that occur within a few kilometers of one another and have similar focal mechanisms, thus generating similar waveforms, allowing measurements to be made via cross-correlation analysis. The waveform database was obtained from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center and includes about 15 million seismograms from 225,000 local earthquakes between 1984 and 2003. A total of 26 billion cross-correlation measurements were performed on a 32-node (64 processor) Linux cluster, using improved analysis tools. All event pairs with separation distances of 5 km or less were processed at all stations that recorded the pair. We computed a total of about 1.7 billion P-wave differential times from pairs of waveforms that had cross-correlation coefficients (CC) of 0.6 or larger. The P-wave differential times are often on the order of a factor of ten to a hundred times more accurate than those obtained from routinely picked phase onsets. 1.2 billion S-wave differential times were measured with CC >= 0.6, a phase not routinely picked at the Northern California Seismic Network because of the noise level of remaining P coda. We found that approximately 95\% of the seismicity includes events that have cross-correlation coefficients of CC >= 0.7 with at least one other event recorded at four or more stations. At some stations more than 40\% of the recorded events are similar at the CC >= 0.9 level, indicating the potential existence of large numbers of repeating earthquakes. Large numbers of correlated events occur in different tectonic regions, including the San Andreas Fault, Long Valley caldera, Geysers geothermal field and Mendocino triple junction. Future research using these data may substantially improve earthquake locations and add insight into the velocity structure in the crust.",

The entire catalog is first relocated by using existing phase picks, a reference ID velocity model, and the SSST method of Richards-Dinger and Shearer (2000). We also perform separate relocations of Imperial Valley events by using a velocity model more suited to this region. Next, we apply cluster analysis to the waveform cross-correlation output to identify similar-event clusters. We relocate earthquakes within each similar-event cluster by using the differential times alone, keeping the cluster centroid fixed to its initial SSST location. We estimate standard errors for the relative locations from the internal consistency of differential locations between individual event pairs; these errors are often as small as tens of meters. In many cases the relocated events within each similar-event cluster align in planar features suggestive of faults. We observe a surprising number of such faults at small scales that strike nearly perpendicular to the main seismicity trends. In general, the fine-scale details of the seismicity reveal a great deal of structural complexity in southern California fault systems.",

The Whittler Narrows sequence is a compact cluster of over 500 events at 12 to 18 km depth located within the dense station coverage of the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN), a telemetered network of several hundred short-period seismographs. SCSN travel time picks and waveforms obtained through the Southern California Earthquake Center are examined for 589 earthquakes between 1981 and 1994 in the vicinity of the mainshock. Using a smoothed version of the standard southern California velocity model and the existing travel time picks, improved location accuracy is obtained through use of the L1 norm rather than the conventional least squares (L2 norm) approach, presumably due to the more robust response of the former to outliers in the data. A large additional improvement results from the use of station terms to account for three-dimensional velocity structure outside of the event cluster. To achieve greater location accuracy, waveforms for these events are resampled and low-pass filtered, and the P and S wave cross-correlation functions are computed at each station for every event pair. For those events with similar waveforms, differential times may be obtained from the cross-correlation functions. These times are then combined with the travel time picks to invert for an adjusted set of picks that are more consistent than the original picks and include seismograms that were originally unpicked. Locations obtained from the adjusted picks show a further improvement in accuracy. Location uncertainties are estimated using a bootstrap technique in which events are relocated many times for sets of picks in which the travel time residuals at the best fitting location are used to randomly perturb each pick. Improvements in location accuracy are indicated by the reduced scatter in the residuals, smaller estimated location errors, and the increased tendency of the locations to cluster along well-defined fault planes. Median standard errors for the final inversion are 150 m in horizontal location and 230 m in vertical location, although the relative locations within localized clusters of similar events are better constrained. Seismicity cross sections resolve the shallow dipping fault plane associated with the mainshock and a steeply dipping fault plane associated with a M-L=5.3 aftershock. These fault planes appear to cross, and activity began on the secondary fault plane prior to the large aftershock.",

More than about 70 per cent of the World's very deep earthquakes occur in this region. About two or three deep shocks and several shallow earthquakes were detected each day by the new network; some of the deep events were as small as magnitude 3. Since more precise hypocentral locations are now available, the zone of activity that dips under the Fiji-Tonga region to depths of about 650 km could be examined in considerable detail. This seismic zone is extremely thin and at some depths is less than about 20 km thick. Nearly all of the small earthquakes in the Fiji-Tonga region are confined to the same narrow zones that are defined by events of larger magnitude. This distribution may be contrasted with the greater scatter of the foci of small shocks in several continental areas. A very active zone of shallow earthquakes north of the Fijian island of Vanua Levu may mark the location of a major submarine fault zone. This zone is part of a larger system of major fault zones that extend from the Tonga arc to Fiji and thence to the New Hebrides arc. Four mechanism solutions for earthquakes located along a seismic zone between Fiji and the southern end of the New Hebrides trench indicate that this zone is typified by strike-slip faulting and thrust faulting.",

	abstract = "It is well established that an earthquake in the Earth's crust can trigger subsequent earthquakes, but such triggering has not been documented for deeper earthquakes. Models for shallow fault interactions suggest that static (permanent) stress changes can trigger nearby earthquakes, within a few fault lengths from the causative earthquake(1-3), whereas dynamic (transient) stresses carried by seismic waves may trigger earthquakes both nearby and at remote distances(4-8). Here we present a detailed analysis of the 19 August 2002 Tonga deep earthquake sequences and show evidence for both static and dynamic triggering. Seven minutes after a magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred at a depth of 598 km, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake (664 km depth) occurred 300 km away, in a previously aseismic region. We found that nearby aftershocks of the first mainshock are preferentially located in regions where static stresses are predicted to have been enhanced by the mainshock. But the second mainshock and other triggered events are located at larger distances where static stress increases should be negligible, thus suggesting dynamic triggering. The origin times of the triggered events do not correspond to arrival times of the main seismic waves from the mainshocks and the dynamically triggered earthquakes frequently occur in aseismic regions below or adjacent to the seismic zone. We propose that these events are triggered by transient effects in regions near criticality, but where earthquakes have difficulty nucleating without external influences.",

Our analysis begins by obtaining preliminary arrival times with a single-trace phase-picking algorithm. For each possible pair of traces we then perform a search for the maximum of their cross-correlation function in order to obtain relative delay times. Depending on event magnitude, the best results are obtained by using correlation windows containing 2 to 4 sec of the initial energy pulse of the phase. The cross-correlation derived delay times are then used to generate an overdetermined system of linear equations whose solution is an optimized set of relative arrival times. We solve for these times using least squares. Cycle skipping is eliminated through the automatic re-evaluation of cross-correlation functions which yield high equation residuals. Quantitative estimates of timing uncertainty are obtained from the variance of equation residuals associated with each trace. Using data from the Washington Regional Seismograph Network, we have found that for reasonably high-quality events, the rms uncertainty in arrival time estimates is on the order of the sample interval (0.01 sec). Reproducibility of delay anomalies is excellent for events from the same geographic locations despite significant differences in waveform character. In connection with a study of the deep structure of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, we include a preliminary examination of the variation of residual patterns with azimuth.",

	abstract = "[1] We have developed a double-difference algorithm to relocate earthquakes recorded at global seismic networks, using differential arrival times for first and later arriving regional and global phases to invert for the vectors connecting the hypocenters. Differential times are formed from global seismic bulletins and are accurately measured on similar seismograms by time domain waveform cross correlation. We evaluate the performance of this spherical, multiphase double-difference algorithm using three-dimensional regional-scale synthetic data and two sets of earthquake data in different tectonic settings. The first includes 3783 intermediate depth earthquakes that occurred between 1964 and 2000 in the subducting Nazca plate beneath northern Chile, where the relocated seismicity confirms a narrowly spaced double seismic zone previously imaged with temporary local seismic data. Residual statistics and comparison with accurately known locations indicate mean relative location errors at the 90\% confidence level of 2.4 km laterally and 1.8 km vertically. Later events typically constrained by cross-correlation data have errors of 1.6 km laterally and 1.4 km vertically. The second data set includes 75 crustal earthquakes in the 1999 Izmit and Duzce, Turkey, aftershock sequences, where the double-difference solutions image orientation and dip of individual fault segments that are consistent with focal mechanisms and near-surface information. Fault complexity likely causes a low level of waveform similarity in this aftershock sequence and thus generates fewer correlated events compared to the Chile earthquakes. Differences between the double-difference locations and corresponding locations in global seismicity catalogs (Earthquake Data Report, EDR; International Seismological Centre, ISC; Engdahl-Hilst-Buland, EHB) are typically greater than 10 km. We evaluate the potential of cross-correlation and double-difference methods to improve hypocenter locations on a global scale.",

There has been no direct petrologic evidence, however, of the return of subducted oceanic crustal components from the lower mantle. We analyzed superdeep diamonds from Juina-5 kimberlite, Brazil, which host inclusions with compositions comprising the entire phase assemblage expected to crystallize from basalt under lower-mantle conditions. The inclusion mineralogies require exhumation from the lower to upper mantle. Because the diamond hosts have carbon isotope signatures consistent with surface-derived carbon, we conclude that the deep carbon cycle extends into the lower mantle.",

There are presently three established algorithms based on such techniques: (1) the method of Jordan and Sverdrup (1981), (2) the double-difference method of Got et al. (1994), and (3) the modified double-difference method of Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2001). We show that the underlying mathematics of these three methods are similar, although there are distinct contrasts in how each is adapted. Our results provide insight into the performance of individual methods. Both the Jordan and Sverdrup (1981) and double difference methods (Got et al., 1994; Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2001) remove the average path anomaly bias in a set of events, but the equation weighting is more ideal in the first method. Distance dependent weighting in the Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2001) method does not reduce earthquake location-dependent path anomaly bias unless damping is applied, but damping causes the locations between earthquakes spaced far apart to be less well resolved. Alternatively, the results using Jordan and Sverdrup (1981) and Got et al. (1994) only remove a constant bias across a model subregion and cannot resolve the relative locations between subregions. The results of this study indicate that differencing operators contain the fundamental limitation that when the path anomalies from velocity heterogeneity change stongly with earthquake position, the bias effects can be reduced in the relative locations between closely spaced earthquakes, but the effects cannot be reduced in the relative locations between earthquakes spaced far apart.",

	abstract = "[ 1] High precision relocation of earthquakes recorded by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) seismic network provides new information on the characteristics of seismic faulting at this oceanic hot spot. Using waveform cross correlation, we have measured correlation coefficients and travel time differences for a set of 14,605 deep (greater than or equal to 13 km) earthquakes recorded from 1988 to 1998. We find that about half of the analyzed earthquakes are in similar event clusters that delineate fault zones in the lower crust and upper mantle. We suggest that much of this deep seismicity reflects rupture in the brittle lithosphere away from the magma pathways, although at Kilauea the stresses from magma movement may additionally help trigger mantle earthquakes on preexisting faults in regions with high differential ambient stresses. Focal mechanisms of similar event clusters throughout Hawaii display characteristic patterns and appear consistent with the hypothesis that deep earthquakes on preexisting faults reflect the stresses due to volcano loading and flexure. We also present the results of applying cross correlation analyses and relocation to -7000 earthquakes at all depths located west of 155.55degreesW and recorded from 1988 to 1998. The pattern of relocated earthquakes at the Kealakekua fault zone is consistent with the presence of a lowangle detachment on the west flank of Mauna Loa.",

The earthquakes we have analyzed predominantly reflect tectonic faulting in the brittle lithosphere rather than magma movement associated with volcanic activity.

	abstract = "Although subducting slabs undergo a bending deformation that resists tectonic plate motions, the magnitude of this resistance is not known because of poor constraints on slab strength. However, because slab bending slows the relatively rapid motions of oceanic plates, observed plate motions constrain the importance of bending. We estimated the slab pull force and the bending resistance globally for 207 subduction zone transects using new measurements of the bending curvature determined from slab seismicity. Predicting plate motions Using a global mantle flow model, we constrain the viscosity of the bending slab to be at most similar to 300 times more viscous than the upper mantle: stronger slabs are intolerably slowed by the bending deformation. Weaker slabs, however, cannot transmit a pull force sufficient to explain rapid trenchward plate motions unless slabs stretch faster than seismically observed rates of similar to 10(-15) s(-1). The constrained bending viscosity (similar to 2 x 10(23) Pa s) is larger than previous estimates that yielded similar or larger bending resistance (here similar to 25\% of forces). This apparent discrepancy occurs because slabs bend more gently than previously thought, with an average radius of curvature of 390 km that permits subduction Of Strong slabs. This gentle bending may ultimately permit plate tectonics on Earth. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

	abstract = "The Fukuoka District Meteorological Observatory recently logged three possible deep low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) beneath eastern Kyushu, Japan, a region in which LFEs and low-frequency tremors have never before been identified. To assess these data, we analyzed band-pass filtered velocity seismograms and relocated LFEs and regular earthquakes using the double-difference method. The results strongly suggest that the three events were authentic LFEs, each at a depth of about 50 km. We also performed relocation analysis on LFEs recorded beneath the Kii Peninsula and found that these LFEs occurred near the northwest-dipping plate interface at depths of approximately 29-38 km. These results indicate that LFEs in southwest Japan occur near the upper surface of the subducting Philippine Sea (PHS) plate. To investigate the origin of regional differences in the occurrence frequency of LFEs in western Shikoku, the Kit Peninsula, and eastern Kyushu, we calculated temperature distributions associated with PHS plate subduction. Then, using the calculated thermal structures and a phase diagram of water dehydration for oceanic basalt, the water dehydration rate (wt.\%/km), which was newly defined in this study,was determined to be 0.19,0.12, and 0.08 in western Shikoku, the Kii Peninsula, and eastern Kyushu, respectively; that is, the region beneath eastern Kyushu has the lowest water dehydration rate value. Considering that the Kyushu-Palau Ridge that is subducting beneath eastern Kyushu is composed of tonalite, which is low in hydrous minerals, this finding suggests that the regionality may be related to the amount of water dehydration associated with subduction of the PHS plate and/or differences in LFE depths. Notable dehydration reactions take place beneath western Shikoku and the Kii Peninsula, where the depth ranges for dehydration estimated by thermal modeling agree well with those for the relocated LFEs. The temperature range in which LFEs occur in these regions is estimated to be 400-500 degrees C. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

	abstract = "Double-difference (DD) tomography is a generalization of DD location; it simultaneously solves for the three-dimensional velocity structure and seismic event locations. DD tomography uses a combination of absolute and more accurate differential arrival times and hierarchically determines the velocity structure from larger scale to smaller scale. This method is able to produce more accurate event locations and velocity structure near the source region than standard tomography, which uses only absolute arrival times. We conduct a stability and uncertainty analysis of DD tomography based on a synthetic data set. Currently three versions of the DD tomography algorithms exist: tomoDD, tomoFDD and tomoADD. TomoDD assumes a flat earth model and uses a pseudo-bending ray-tracing algorithm to find rays between events and stations while tomoFDD uses a finite-difference travel-time algorithm and the curvature of the Earth is considered. Both codes are based on a regularly distributed inversion grid, with the former for a local scale and the latter for a regional scale. In contrast, tomoADD adapts the inversion mesh to match with the data distribution based on tetrahedral and Voronoi diagrams. We discuss examples of applying DD tomography to characterize fault zone structure, image high-resolution structure of subduction zones, and determine the velocity structure of volcanoes.",

We test this method on a synthetic dataset and find that it produces a more accurate velocity model and event locations than standard tomography. We also test this method on a Hayward fault, California, earthquake dataset spanning 1984-1998. The earthquakes relocated by this method collapse to a thin line along the fault trace, consistent with previous results.

	abstract = "[1] It is shown how a change in orientation between the source mechanism of two identically located double couple sources can be estimated from the correlation of the coda waves excited by their sources. The change in orientation is given by the root mean square of the change in strike, Delta phi(s) dip, Delta delta and rake, Delta lambda of the double couple. It is not possible to determine Delta phi(s), Delta delta or Delta lambda individually from the cross correlation. Applicability of the theory is tested using synthetic waveforms generated from a 3D finite difference solver for the elastic wave equation. Changes in strike, dip and rake are tested independently and simultaneously. In each case a crossover point is identified such that the actual change in orientation is within one standard deviation of the coda wave interferometry (CWI) estimates for all rotations below the crossover. After the crossover, the CWI estimates give a lower bound on the change in orientation. Crossover points of 30 degrees, 62 degrees, and 56 degrees, respectively are observed when the strike, dip and rake are varied independently. When all angles are varied simultaneously by the same quantity the crossover point is 17 degrees. The new theory can be applied in combination with existing coda wave interferometry techniques for estimating source separation. It creates the potential for joint relative location and focal mechanism determination using information from seismic coda recorded at a single station.",

Coda wave interferometry is a technique that exploits this sensitivity to estimate slight changes in the medium from a comparison of the coda waves before and after the perturbation. For spatially localized changes in the velocity, or for changes in the source location, the travel-time perturbation may be different for different scattering paths. The coda waves that arrive within a certain time window are therefore subject to a distribution of travel-time perturbations. Here I present the general theory of coda wave interferometry, and show how the time-shifted correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the mean and variance of the distribution of travel-time perturbations. I show how this general theory can be used to estimate changes in the wave velocity, in the location of scatterer positions, and in the source location.",

In this study we use the air pressure and displacement recorded at the Arenal Volcano to detect temporal changes.

By deconvolving the ground motion with the air pressure for different time intervals we obtain a highly repeatable displacement signal that has the character of diffusive wave propagation. This deconvolved displacement signal changes with the time interval analyzed in the employed data. This change can be explained by a shift in the point of excitation of the elastic waves over a distance of about 15 meters.",

Particular attention is paid to questions related to the elasticity and thermal equations of solids (especially at high pressures and temperatures) and phenomenology of phase transitions. Examples of applications of these ideas include modeling the thermal structure of the Earth's core and mantle, elucidation of the origin of the anisotropy of the D″ region, and a schematic picture of the effects of the spin transition of iron impurities on the properties of iron-bearing minerals in the Earth's mantle. },
